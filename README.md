# stock_price_prediction

Focus on Powergrid's stock trend prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. Here's an overview of what was done:

Data Collection:

Used yfinance to download Powergrid's stock data (POWERGRID.NS) from January 1, 2000, to November 1, 2024.
Stored it in a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:

Likely included handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Might have created sequences for time-series forecasting.
Feature Selection & Transformation:

Converted data into a format suitable for LSTM, ensuring it meets the 3D input shape: (batch_size, time_steps, seq_len).
Explanation of LSTM input structure was given.
Model Development:

Possibly built an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Defined layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions.
Training & Evaluation:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained the LSTM model.
Evaluated performance using loss metrics like RMSE or MSE.
Predictions & Visualization:

Made future stock trend predictions.
Visualized actual vs. predicted trends.

Final Insights

Builded an LSTM model to predict Powergridâ€™s stock price based on past data.
The predictions follow the actual trend well, but exact stock price movements are challenging to forecast.
Key Learnings:
LSTM models work well for time-series forecasting but require large datasets.
Stock market trends depend on multiple external factors like economic events, policies, and global influences, which aren't included in the model.
Performance can be improved by adding technical indicators, macro-economic data, or attention mechanisms.
