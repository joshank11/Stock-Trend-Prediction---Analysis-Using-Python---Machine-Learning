# stock_price_prediction

Focus on Powergrid's stock trend prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. Here's an overview of what was done:

Data Collection:

Used yfinance to download Powergrid's stock data (POWERGRID.NS) from January 1, 2000, to November 1, 2024.
Stored it in a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:

Likely included handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Might have created sequences for time-series forecasting.
Feature Selection & Transformation:

Converted data into a format suitable for LSTM, ensuring it meets the 3D input shape: (batch_size, time_steps, seq_len).
Explanation of LSTM input structure was given.
Model Development:

Possibly built an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Defined layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions.
Training & Evaluation:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained the LSTM model.
Evaluated performance using loss metrics like RMSE or MSE.
Predictions & Visualization:

Made future stock trend predictions.
Visualized actual vs. predicted trends.

Final Insights

Builded an LSTM model to predict Powergridâ€™s stock price based on past data.
The predictions follow the actual trend well, but exact stock price movements are challenging to forecast.

Key Learnings:
LSTM models work well for time-series forecasting but require large datasets.
Stock market trends depend on multiple external factors like economic events, policies, and global influences, which aren't included in the model.
Performance can be improved by adding technical indicators, macro-economic data, or attention mechanisms.

1. Future Price Prediction
ðŸ“Œ "What will be the future closing price of Powergrid stock?"

Using LSTM, the model aimed to predict the next-day stock price based on historical trends.
Investors use this information for decision-making on buying, holding, or selling stocks.

2. Trend Identification
ðŸ“Œ "Is Powergrid stock in an uptrend, downtrend, or stable phase?"

The model analyzed past price patterns to recognize whether the stock was experiencing bullish (uptrend) or bearish (downtrend) movements.
Helps traders decide if they should enter or exit a position.

3. Volatility Analysis
ðŸ“Œ "How volatile is Powergridâ€™s stock, and what is the level of risk?"

By examining historical fluctuations in stock prices, investors can assess risk.
High volatility signals high risk but also high reward opportunities.

4. Support & Resistance Levels
ðŸ“Œ "What are the key support and resistance levels?"

Identifying price levels where the stock historically bounces back (support) or faces resistance (sellers take control) helps traders set stop-loss and take-profit levels.
5. Impact of Market Trends
ðŸ“Œ "How do macroeconomic trends and industry factors affect Powergridâ€™s stock?"

If external events (interest rates, government policies, or energy sector trends) influence stock movements, these patterns could be integrated into future models.

6. Trading Strategy Optimization
ðŸ“Œ "Can we automate trading strategies based on predicted trends?"

If predictions show consistent accuracy, they could be integrated into algorithmic trading models for automated buying/selling decisions.

7. Comparison with Benchmarks
ðŸ“Œ "How does Powergridâ€™s stock perform compared to market indices like NIFTY 50 or sectoral indices?"

Helps investors understand relative strength and decide if it's better to invest in Powergrid or other stocks.
